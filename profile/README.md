## Welcome

Nautilus Cyberneering SL, an upstart subsidiary of the Block Finance AG group, has the mission cultivate an open source software engineering and development team. This will provide strategic and practical advantages for the group.

## History

Originally started as Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH and based out of Germany, Block Finance AG wholly purchased the company and liquidate the original company structure, transferring all intellectual property and other rights to the group.

Simultaneously, the group took inspiration of the business concept that Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH had and decided to re-create a similar company in the more favorable jurisdiction and climate of Las Palmas, Grand Canaria; thus Nautilus Cyberneering SL was born, the direct spiritual successor from Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH.

## Goals

Block Finance AG has significant need for in-group world-class computer science engineering and development capabilities, and is duly aware that establishing such capabilities in beautiful running and vibrant professional team quality is an non-trivial endeavour.

Nautilus adopts the strategy of focusing sponsoring and facilitating the development of open-source projects as a way to gain real-world experience of software engineering, project management, and team building. The projects we focus on along with the associated languages and technologies, have been selected with the goal of being attractive for competent and passionate software engineers.

The secondary goal of our sponsorship and facilitation of interesting open-source projects is that these projects may become successful in their own right; growing a vibrant and active community around them; positioning Nautilus with additional exposure and access to a sympathetic market of talented software engineers, developers, architects, testers, administrators, community focalises, and supportive end users.

Nautilus success is to find itself surrounded with pools of brilliant talent that have accumulated from the natural community growth that accompanies healthy open-source projects. The entire Block Finance Group can draw from these well connect pools; giving the group access to great talent, and the community access to friendly professional employment and sponsorship opportunities.

## Ethos

Nautilus strongly accepts the reality that open-source software becomes dominant in the long-term; that the open-collaboration and competition of ideas leads the best outcomes succeeding, and that open-source exemplifies this in a very practical and real way.

While there can be temporary advantage, particularly for new project or company in the to protect their "secret sauce", or source code, from competing eyes; Nautilus has the luxury for that its business foals are aligned orthogonal from market direct market product competition ‚Äî instead we positioning ourselves to be attractive for great talent: whereas more loving attention towards our projects, either competitive or not, will directly contribute to our success.

The Block Finance Group, like everyone, shares the fundamental grounding belief to be good and kind is the fundament of fulfillment: profit must in monetary success in harmony with the betterment world.

Nautilus places great importance of being fair, kind, reasonable, transparent, intelligent, and empathetic. We wish to foster a culture of personal growth, leading to co-independence: where teams and individuals act in self-responsibility and cooperation. Our corporate structures continually evolve through self-and-group reflection; leading to a greater fostering our ethos in all parts of our operations.

## Projects

Since 2023, the primary focus of Nautilus has been on the Torrust Project:

### Torrust


`Torrust` is a group of programs that allow for the better management of torrent collections. Nautilus made the commitment to strategically foster this project as it is confident that it is in close alignment with both the Ethos of the company, (and group), and the real company goal nearing itself to a very interesting natural talent pool.

in particular, our ethos is can be expressed as a:

- value of sharing and archival of information. (such as AI and experimental datasets)
- interest of open networking systems, and standards.
- indexing and protection of data for future generations.

In addition, for more practical reasons:

- rust is an interesting and increasingly popular programming language
- there is large communities of passionate users of other torrent trackers and indexes

#### Torrust Tracker

A `Torrent Tracker` is a set of server services that allow for the torrent swam to match-make while optionally keeping useful statistics for better insight and choice making.

The tracker connects peers who share the same torrent (infohash, i.e. a unique specifier for a torrent). A peer that is missing parts or all of the torrent data is then able to connect to other peers, and obtain the parts they are missing.

The torrust tracker is unique as it is a modern implementation in the excellent rust programming language. We hope that this project will become well-used and provide a real benefit to many; and will attract a vibrant community around it's continued improvement and maintenance.

#### Torrust Index

A `Torrent Index` is a software that manages metadata associated, but not necessarily directly embedded inside, torrents. This allows users to find torrents that interest them. A popular example is the "accademictorrents" website. This website provides contextual information about a torrent; such as it's name, upload date, and relevant keywords or category.

Torrent Indexes often all sorts of additional features, such as: user accounts, moderation, a blog, searching and filtering of results, and displaying statistics provided by connected trackers.

Our torrust index is again unique in that it has a very modern design, using the rust programming language, and offers a good range of features.



We are currently a small team of people working towards our long term vision. Our vision is to create open source software ecosystems, with a particular focus on AI and Machine Learning solutions.
Our team is both made up of employees and external collaborators. We come from different professional backgrounds and countries.
Most of us are developers but some of us are not.

Things that define us as a team are:

- The believe that everyone can add value
- The constant strive to learn and improve ourselves
- The believe that all we do has an impact on others and our planet
- The convincement that technology has great potential and value for individuals and companies

Essentially, we care for:

- People and the community
- Transparency
- Learning & sharing of knowledge
- The free availability of software and technology through Open-Source software
- The responsible use of technology
- Nature

Given this we operate according to these values and we strive to create value with everything we do and share it with the community.

## Current In-House Expertise ü§ìüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

Our current internal developer employee members have on average more than 15 years of professional experience in the field. Some of the programming languages they have worked with extensively are Java, JS, Typescript, Python, etc. This fact implies also that they are comfortable in using the common related frameworks and tools used within these languages.

In addition, several of them have also worked closely connected to relevant Blockchain implementations, as well as worked on software security for open-source and closed-source projects. All important elements that we will introduce in our projects.

## Growing In-House Expertise üëÄ üß† üìñ üîç

Our skill set is constantly growing as we explore the best ways to realize our long term project. For example when we work on our projects we sometimes take small detours. Such detours are to deepen our knowledge in areas that we consider important.

As it usually is the case, during this process once we understand the topic at a deeper level we discover areas for improvement. An example of this are our Git-Queue and Librarian projects.

The aim of these two spin-off projects are to facilitate automation for repositories which are an essential part for our project. While developing these two we had to deepen our understanding of how Git and GitHub work, and in the process we discovered some possible security enhancements that will benefit all repository users.

## Where are we located :earth_africa:

Our company headquarters are located in Gr√ºnwald, a beautiful small town just outside of Munich, Germany. However, almost all of us are working remotely and we have team members in different countries.
You will find us in Germany, Spain and China.

## Our Journey :rocket:

We just started our journey together in 2021. We have just taken the first steps of our journey to realize our vision.

### Years 2022-2023

We intend to:

- Bring the power of AI directly to the end user on his local desktop with modular extensions and a plaftorm to create these
- Create a community around our product and platform to further develop our vision and make it its own

All this so that the community learns, teaches and drives the direction and evolution of solutions, and this without any external influences.

## Our Projects  :bulb:

Each of our current projects has a specific purpose to address core elements that we need to learn to realize our long term vision.

### Long term Projects Overview  :telescope:  :dart:

This is a link to our [first long-term project's roadmap repository](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/ai_assistant_roadmap).

### Spin-off repositories with potential for general use

Along the way to develop our long term project we will require to develop custom solutions to challenges we face, which nevertheless, may be of use to the others.
The resulting products can take different forms but we list them under each Steppingstone project in a section called spin-offs.

### Current Stepping Stone Projects (SSP) :nut_and_bolt:

With everything we do we attempt to create value from the start.
In this case we are helping a collaborating company in solving one of their needs, and at the same time we are learning about one of the key components that we will require to realize our vision.

## Documentation :page_with_curl: :bar_chart:

All of our projects have documentation specific to themselves, such as contribution guidelines, etc. However, we have some General documentation of interest for contributors that relate to security and using GitHub listed below.

<https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/secure-git-guide>

## Licenses üßæ

The different repositories may have one or more licenses. These licenses can be found in a markdown file called "LICENSE.md"  in the main folders. In addition to this file, you may also find a folder called "Licensing". This folder is common when there is more than one applicable license. This can be the case when there is for example code and media in the same repository.
