### Why

- Use Toggl to know how you spend your time.
- It helps you see where you may waste time and how productive you are.
- You can create reports for your own history and see how you are managing your time.
- It helps for the invoicing when we use this data to reinvoice to customers, such as our internal companies.

- Making use of the projects for gross categorization, useful especially for internal purposes such as reinvoicing.
- In addition to the project names that are invoiced there are the following projects that we use internally for the purpose of checking hour our time is used.
    - Learning (Any time spent on personal learning unrelated to any of the projects that are invoiced)
    - Administrative (Paperwork, dealing with internal requests)
    - Blogging
    - Event (Team meetings, )


Examples of current project names that are being invoiced to internal companies:
- Torrust (Any repository from this organization in GitHub)

### Descriptive entries

- Creating descriptive entries are key for knowing what exactly you are working on at all times. An issue, a meeting, an email, etc.
- The more specific and consistent in your entrie format you are the better for you and anyone reviewing it.
- Also the more consistent you are the faster the suggestions will pop up when writing the descriptions.

Examples of possible descriptions:
- Issue #378
- PR #12 - Review
- PR #12 - Correction  
- Weekly Dev Meeting
- One on One
- Learning Python functions


### Tags

- Tags are useful mostly for yourself.
- You can see them as a way to create subcategories for your own reports, like for example if you want to know how much time you are spending on issues, you could create a tag called issues.
