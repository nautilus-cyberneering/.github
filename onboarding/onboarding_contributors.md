# Onboarding Repository Paid Contributors

This is the onboarding document for our new repository paid contributors.

## First day

- We will define with you your own customized onboarding plan.
- You are invited to request our help to go over any of the repositories.

## Communication

- We try to avoid private communication except for things like private data. GitHub issues, pull requests, GitHub discussions and comments are the things we mostly use.
- Email.
- We have a development Telegram chat.

## Meetings

- We only have one regular meeting a week, which we usually use to share issues about the projects, and mid-term planning.
- There can be other meetings from time to time where we will set future sprints or discuss project related topics.

## Training

- Different team members will provide necessary training to new team members on certain topics to bring them up to speed. The training will be arranged in coordination with the new team member.

## List of tools that we use
